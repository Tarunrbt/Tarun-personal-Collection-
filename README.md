## Matter-Originated Spacetime Gradient Model (MOSGM)

A unified research and reproducibility repository documenting the theoretical, computational, and observational framework of the Matter-Originated Spacetime Gradient Model (MOSGM).

---

## Core Proposition

MOSGM proposes that spacetime curvature emerges directly from local baryonic matter gradients, leading to a gravitational regime transition below a characteristic acceleration scale:

a0 ≈ 1.2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m s⁻²

This transition produces a parameter-free baryonic threshold radius:

r_t = √(G M_b / a0)

At r ≈ r_t, MOSGM predicts a localized non-analytic enhancement in dynamical observables.

## Observational Status

## Current Status

Preliminary stacked cluster analysis indicates a localized feature near the predicted transition scale.

Further robustness checks and independent replication are ongoing.
