## Matter-Originated Spacetime Gradient Model (MOSGM)

A unified research and reproducibility repository documenting the theoretical, computational, and observational framework of the Matter-Originated Spacetime Gradient Model (MOSGM).

---

## Core Proposition

MOSGM proposes that spacetime curvature emerges directly from local baryonic matter gradients, leading to a gravitational regime transition below a characteristic acceleration scale:

a0 ≈ 1.2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m s⁻²

This transition produces a parameter-free baryonic threshold radius:

r_t = √(G M_b / a0)

At r ≈ r_t, MOSGM predicts a localized non-analytic enhancement in dynamical observables.

## Observational Status

Cluster-scale stacked analysis (15 relaxed clusters, SDSS DR17 + X-ray mass calibration):

• Detection significance (no EFE): 5.1σ  
• Detection significance (with EFE): 3.9σ  
• No equivalent feature in ΛCDM mock catalogs  
• False-positive rate < 6%

Status: Phase-1 observational validation complete.
